Hearthstone Card Bot

This is an IRC bot which extracts and analysis card data from Hearthstone, parses it, and allows users to query this data from IRC.

To use, simply download the bin\Release files and edit config.xml. Then run hsbot.exe

To refresh "cardata" wth the newest cards, run on a PC with Hearthstone installed.

Once online, you can say things like
"!card Arcane Intel"

or

"OMG he killed me with a [Pyroblast]!"
